    project_description: This is an app written in React. It's purpose is to let
      users schedule events or meetings, called 'reservations' in the app. You
      can add reservations, edit them, or remove. If more than one person is
      using the app, there is an option to quickly send messages that everybody
      can read. The app also checks for closest free teems in or closest
      upcoming reservations, on which you can doubleclick, or tap in mobile
      version, and quickly move into the view of clicked reservation, or create
      a new one if you click on free term. In the original app there is an
      authentication and login screen with additional tab for personal settings
      in the sidebar, but I stripped them off from the portfolio version of the
      app for the sake of simplicity of the user that just wants to quickly look
      into the app
